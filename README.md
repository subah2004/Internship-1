# Introduction 

Welcome to my repository! 🌟 

This collection of projects and scripts showcases the work I have done during my internship, focusing on Python, SQL, and Flask. As a firm believer that no matter how much experience we have in coding, there's always something new to learn, this repository reflects my journey of constant learning and exploration in the world of programming. 🚀

In this repository, you'll find a variety of projects that demonstrate my skills and knowledge across these three technologies:

    🐍 Python
    🗃️ SQL
    🌐 Flask


I invite you to explore the projects, use the code, and even contribute if you find something that sparks your interest. Let's learn and grow together! 💡✨
